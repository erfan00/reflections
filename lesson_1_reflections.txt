If depends on the contents they store, for example, programmers use git to track their program, usually containing mulfi-files that related with each other. People use google docs to store some independent or seperately things.

Using git log, I can get a whole history of the files, I can see all the commits made before. Using git diff, I can get to know what changes had been made between two versions of files.

It keeps track of all the former information. So even if I messed up something currently, I can find some former versions of it and get it recovered.
